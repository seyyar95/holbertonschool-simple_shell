.TH SHELL 1 "December 2023" "Version 1.0" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
shell \- a basic shell interface for continuous command execution

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBshell\fP program is a simple shell interface that allows users to execute commands continuously. It prompts and executes user commands until the user exits or encounters an end-of-file (EOF).

When executed without any arguments, \fBshell\fP displays the command prompt "#cisfun$ " and waits for user input. It then reads the user's command, executes it, and repeats the process until the user exits.

If \fBshell\fP is receiving input from a pipe, it omits the command prompt and continuously reads and executes commands from the input stream.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exits the \fBshell\fP shell.

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
In interactive mode, \fBshell\fP provides a command prompt for the user to enter commands. It displays "#cisfun$ " and waits for the user to input a command. The user can enter any valid shell command, and \fBshell\fP will execute it.

.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
When \fBshell\fP is part of a pipeline and receiving input from a pipe, it operates in non-interactive mode. In this mode, it continuously reads commands from the input stream and executes them without displaying the command prompt.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBshell\fP program always returns 0 upon successful completion.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B 1.
Run \fBshell\fP interactively:
.BR $ shell
BR #cisfun$ ls
file1 file2 file3
BR #cisfun$ exit

.TP
.B 2.
Use \fBshell\fP in a pipeline:
.BR $ echo "ls" | shell
file1 file2 file3
